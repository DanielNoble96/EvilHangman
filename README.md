# EvilHangman
A game of hangman where the computer cheats, making it really tough to win.
Each time you choose a letter, the computer picks from the set of words with the most options and decides whether or not to tell you that it contains the letter. The computer never really selects a word, just chooses the set of words within the constraint that your guess imposes on it to continues to change the set by picking the one that gives it the most options.
